Peter Horvath's dotfiles.
=========================
Welcome to my dotfiles, where originality doesn't matter and most things are stolen.

Vim
===
Install the vim plugins via vundle:
- 1. Get vundle
    `git clone https://github.com/gmarik/vundle.git ~/.vim/bundle/vundle`
- 2. Start vim and run the command to the plugins that are set in .vimrc
   `:BundleInstall`

The rest of the config files just need to be pointed to from the home dir.
