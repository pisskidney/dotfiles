Peter Horvath's dotfiles.
=========================
Welcome to my dotfiles, where originality doesn't matter and most things are stolen.

Vim
===
Install the vim plugins via vundle:
1.  git clone https://github.com/gmarik/vundle.git ~/.vim/bundle/vundle
2.  Launch vim, run :BundleInstall

The rest of the config files just need to be pointed to from the home dir.
