Peter Horvath's dotfiles.
=========================
Welcome to my dotfiles, where originality doesn't matter and most things are stolen.

Set-up
============
Run `wget -qO- https://github.com/pisskidney/dotfiles/raw/master/bootstrap.sh | /bin/bash`

Plugin Installation
===================
Launch `vim` and run `:BundleInstall` or run `vim +BundleInstall +qall` in the cli.
