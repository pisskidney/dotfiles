# Peter Horvath's dotfiles.
Welcome to my dotfiles, where originality doesn't matter and most things are stolen.

# Prerequisits
    * nodejs (brew install node) (needed by CoC)
    * flake8 (https://pypi.org/project/flake8/)
    * oh-my-zsh (https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)

## Set-up
Run `curl -s -L https://github.com/pisskidney/dotfiles/raw/master/bootstrap.sh | /bin/bash`

* **What this all does:**
    - clones the dotfiles repo to ~/.dotfiles
    - creates proper symlinks to all config files

# After set-up
    * Check .vimrc vim-flake8 settings and set the flake8 executable path properly
